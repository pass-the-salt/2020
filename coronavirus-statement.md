# Coronavirus - COVID19 Statement

---

Dear attendees, speakers and sponsors,

<b><u>Last updates</u></b>

We're coming to you to give you an update on the conference. 
* We are carefully monitoring the evolution of the Coronavirus COVID19 outbreak.
* Due to current instructions from the French government (closing universities, cancelling events with more than 100 attendees), Polytech school cancels all events, with no end date for this decision.

<b><u>Our thoughts</u></b>

Our event is scheduled from June 29 to July 1, 2020. It is 3 months and a half away from now (mid March). A lot of evolutions are expected about this outbreak until then. 

<b><u>Our decisions</u></b>

* CFP: we extend our Call For Papers ending date to April 30th, 2020 in order to give you time and peace of mind to submit your research or workshop.
* EVENT: we maintain our intention to run the onsite event scheduled as foreseen from June 29 to July 1, 2020.
* LAST CALL: we will take our last decision about running or not the conference as a physical event on May 31th, 2020.
* EVENT FORM: If it won't be not possible, for any reason, to run it as a physical event, we will do our best to run it as a virtual conference. We will work hard during next weeks to be able to do it if we have to!<br> SO PLEASE: submit your research, we will do our very best to give the best exposure to it and share the knowledge!

Be assured we are focused on running this event in the safest way possible and we continue to monitor on a daily basis the evolution of the outbreak and the governmental instructions.

<b>Thank you for your commitment to make Pass the SALT a great event for all of us!</b>
