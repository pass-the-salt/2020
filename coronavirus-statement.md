# Final Statement

---

Dear attendees, speakers and sponsors,

Due to the evolution of the COVID19 outbreak, we can not be sure to be able to organize safely an onsite event in July.

In order:
* to protect our attendees and speakers,
* and to give an outcome to the research done by Security and Free Software speakers

we have decided to organize Pass the SALT 2020 virtually. 

**This edition will be done remotely under a webinar format** roughly at the same dates, June 29 - July 1.

Obviously, there will be only talks and no workshop. Sorry for that.

We are now waiting for your submission dear speakers: [https://cfp.pass-the-salt.org/](https://cfp.pass-the-salt.org/) :-)

<b>Thank you for your commitment to make Pass the SALT a great event for all of us!</b>
