* We are carefully monitoring the evolution of the Coronavirus COVID19 outbreak.
* Current instructions from the French government are to cancel indoor events with more than 5000 attendees planned until 31st May.

<b>Therefore our event is still scheduled as foreseen from June 29 to July 1, 2020</b>.

We monitor on a daily basis the evolution of the governmental instructions.

In case of instructions that would affect our event, we will be back to you ASAP to inform you about the evolution of the situation.

<b>Thank you</b> for your commitment to make Pass the SALT a great event for all of us!
