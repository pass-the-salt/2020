<p>Dear attendees, speakers and sponsors,</p>

<p><b><u>Final statement</u></b></p>

<p>Due to the evolution of the COVID19 outbreak, we can not be sure to be able to organize safely an onsite event in July.</p>

<p>In order:</p>
<ul>
  <li>to protect our attendees and speakers,</li>
  <li>and to give an outcome to the research done by Security and Free Software speakers</li>
</ul>

<p>we have decided to organize Pass the SALT 2020 virtually.</p>

<p><strong>This edition will be done remotely under a webinar format</strong> roughly at the same dates, June 29 - July 1.</p>

<p>Obviously, there will be only talks and no workshop. Sorry for that.</p>

<p>We are now waiting for your submission dear speakers: <a href="https://cfp.pass-the-salt.org/">https://cfp.pass-the-salt.org/</a> :-)</p>

<p><b>Thank you for your commitment to make Pass the SALT a great event for all of us!</b></p>
