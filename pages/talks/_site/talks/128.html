<hr />

<p>Traditionally, when you run a workload in a VM, container or in a serverless environment, that workload is vulnerable to interference by any person or software with hypervisor, root or kernel access. That turns out to be quite a few people one has little choice but to trust, both in the cloud, of course, but also on one’s own hardware.</p>

<p>The Enarx project aims to mitigate this by leveraging the hardware-based security properties offered by the Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) found on recent CPUs. Enarx will make it simple to deploy workloads to a variety of TEEs in the public cloud, making it possible to deploy confidential workloads to third party servers without needing to relinquish trust to those who operate them.</p>

<p>We’ve known for a long time that we need encryption for data at rest and in transit; Enarx helps you do encryption for data in use.</p>

<p>Enarx handles two crucial aspects of using TEEs: attestation and delivery of an application into a run-time, what we call a “Keep”.</p>

<p>CPU-architecture independent, Enarx enables the same application code to be deployed across multiple targets, abstracting issues such as cross-compilation and differing attestation mechanisms between hardware vendors.</p>

<p>Applications deployed to Enarx are based on WebAssembly, offering developers a wide range of language choice for implementation and eliminating the need to rewrite the application for a particular platform or SDK. Work is currently underway on AMD SEV and Intel SGX.
The Enarx project is open source and looking to expand our community involvement.</p>
