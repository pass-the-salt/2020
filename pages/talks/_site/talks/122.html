<hr />

<p>In February 2020, Let’s Encrypt announced that they had issued a billion certificates. This is a sign of how encryption for network traffic has continued to gain adoption among regular individuals as well as among malicious actors. Decryption of this traffic may look at first as the solution to recover the lost visibility but it is not always an option because of privacy consideration or even technical reason. In this webinar, we’ll discuss several approaches to analyze encrypted network traffic with Suricata. We will look at Suricata’s JA3/JA3S support, TLS/SSL and newest protocol anomaly detection capabilities. By the end of this webinar you’ll have the insight needed to leverage Suricata to perform more effective analysis of encrypted network traffic.</p>
