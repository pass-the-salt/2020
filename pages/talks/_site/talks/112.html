<h2 id="remote-forensic-investigations-for-the-win">Remote Forensic Investigations For The Win</h2>
<hr />

<p>If you’re performing incident handling, you probably already faced this situation: “Friday, 5PM, your phone rings because a customer detected some suspicious activity on a server or a workstation. Of course, it must be investigated “as soon as possible”. The server is physically located 500km away, not easy to start to investigate. Why not use a toolbox that can be booted on any system (server, workstation, physical, virtual, cloud, …) and launch some investigations in a safe way but under the customer’s control and supervision?</p>

<p>During this talk, I’ll present you “Bitscout”, a customizable live CD based on free tools and created to perform remote forensic investigations. This project was created by Vitaly Kamluk but I already submitted some pull requests to improve the project and used it in real cases!</p>

<p>After a quick review of an incident handling process and its classic issues, I will present the tool itself and compare it to classic solutions based on agents. The architecture will be described and several use cases will be demonstrated (ex: booting the compromized server, take a memory image, scanning the filesystem, etc). Several demos will be prepared (crossing fingers ;-)</p>
